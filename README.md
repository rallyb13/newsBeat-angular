```
On the Beat: an angular JS website for news agencies.
```

OtB allows the assignment editor to keep track of the separate news "beats"
(e.g.: local, political, delicious) and assign reporters to them.
It further allows for storing information about specific reporters
(e.g: name, how long they've been at the paper, and birthday).


No bugs as of yet, but the current setup doesn't allow a reporter to exist
independent of a beat, or to be on multiple beats at once without being
completely re-entered. This is mostly because I'm new to angular.
